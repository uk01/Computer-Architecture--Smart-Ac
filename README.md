# Computer organisation and Architecture Term Project
Design a Smart Air Conditioner which is a 16 bit machine.

## Assembler Design
1. A C program has been written which will convert the mnemonic code of our machine to its equivalent binary machine code.
2. Our assembler has been tested for specific scenarios.

## Machine Simulation
1. A C program has been written to  implement the designed ISA as a computing machine which takes binary machine instructions 
   as an input and produces the final output.
2. The status of registers, ALU control signals and flag register has been displayed for each instruction execution.
